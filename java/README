The Hackathon API Test application
----------------------------------

This sample application is meant to be a showcase of the functionalities provided
by the Zalando Hackathon API.

To build the application, Apache Maven is required. This was tested on Maven 3.0.x
but it should work on Mave 2.x without problems. Simple open a command prompt /
shell on this folder and run the follow command:

mvn package

This command will generate the application package and javadocs. To execute the
application, do the following:

cd target
java -jar hackathon-test.jar

The application is a Swing application and the use should be self explanatory for
the most part. The first thing to do is to fill the "Shop Address" text box and 
request the list of domains. If a valid Zalando shop address is supplied, the
"Domains" tab should be filled with information about domains and all the other
tabs should have their domain combo boxes filled as well. Each tab is meant to
be able to call one of the operations provided by the Hackathon API and present
on a crude manner the data returned.

To see the Javadocs generated during the build, point your web browser to the
following file:

target/site/apidocs/index.html

As a regular Maven project, this project could be opened directly or imported by
the most popular Java IDEs available, such as Eclipse, Netbeans or IntelliJ.
